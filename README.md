***Concurrent HTTP Proxy Server***

    CS425: Computer Networking 

    Proxy server supports the GET method to serve clients requests and then connects to requested host and responds with host data.
    It can handle requests from both protocols HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0.
    Multiple clients can connect and make request to it at the same time.
    Server perfectly provides appropriate Status-code and Response-Phrase values in response to errors or incorrect requests from client.
    Server is designed such that it can run continuously until an unrecoverable error occurs.
